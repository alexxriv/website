        The Unbearable Slowness of Being: How to Get Rid of Our Thinking
        Bottleneck
      </h1>
      <p style="color: #888">2025 Jan 04</p>
      <p>
        Recently, I stumbled upon a paper titled
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10234"
          >“The Unbearable Slowness of Being: Why Do We Live at 10 Bits/s?”</a
        >
        . The premise is thought-provoking: humans think at a painfully slow
        rate of 10 bits per second. When we compare the mere 10 bits to the
        billions of bits of data our bodies gather each second, we can only stay
        with an uncomfotarble feeling of curiosity. This vast disparity begs the
        question—what would life be like if we could think faster? Could we
        somehow stretch the narrow pipeline through which our thoughts flow? And
        more importantly, is there a way to achieve it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine it. We’ve evolved to think one thing at a time, to process and
        communicate in single-threaded streams of thought. Yet, the world around
        us surges with a deluge of data, much of which is either discarded or
        compressed into simplified versions our minds can manage. Even our
        perception of the world is a finely crafted illusion. Take vision as an
        example: our eyes capture a tremendous amount of sensory data, yet the
        sharp, vibrant world we "see" is
        <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niaa025/6032859"
          >mostly a mental fabrication</a
        >. Outside of a laser-thin area of focus, everything else we see is in
        reality blurred out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could this bottleneck—the disparity between the flood of sensory input
        and the drip of conscious thought—be why life often feels unbearably
        slow? Perhaps is what drives our collective obsession with short videos,
        fast-paced games, and other dopamine-laced distractions. These pursuits
        might be an unconscious attempt to cram more "bits" into our subjective
        experience, compensating for the agonizing slowness of our inner
        monologue. But is there a better way to bridge the gap?
      </p>
      <h2>Breaking the Bottleneck: A Future Beyond Slow Thought</h2>
      <p>
        The good news (maybe?) is, we’ve already started expanding our bandwidth
        in unexpected ways. Take communication. For most of history, our
        thoughts had to travel through sound waves—words spoken into the air,
        lost if not immediately heard. Today, we transmit ideas almost instantly
        across the globe via binary signals. Knowledge storage, once dependent
        on memorization or physical texts, has been outsourced to the cloud.
        Even memories themselves are increasingly offloaded to photos, videos,
        and digital records.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next frontier might be even more ambitious: outsourcing our input
        and output systems. Companies like Neuralink are already developing
        high-bandwidth interfaces that could bypass our natural sensory and
        motor channels. Instead of relying solely on slow, linear streams of
        language or vision, such technology could enable direct, rapid data
        exchange between humans and machines—or even between humans themselves,
        <a href="https://x.com/waitbutwhy">@waitbutwhy</a> calls it
        <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html#part5"
          >The Wizard Era</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why stop there? If we can enhance how we gather and express
        information, could we eventually transcend the bottleneck of internal
        thought? Imagine a world where we no longer think in sequential streams,
        but in parallel networks—our minds processing ideas as swiftly as
        computers calculate equations.
      </p>
      <h2>Outsourcing Ourselves: The Final Leap?</h2>
      <p>
        Such advancements raise profound questions. If we externalize not just
        our communication and memory but also our very thinking, would we still
        be human? Or would we transcend our current state, becoming something
        entirely new—perhaps something better? What would civilization look like
        if every individual could process the billions of bits of data they
        perceive every second? I believe this leap will define the next era of
        our evolution, and I can’t help but feel optimistic about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, there’s fear. A subtle, nagging worry about disconnection, about
        flying too close to the sun, about losing the core of what makes us
        human. But isn't this fear always there, whispering in the background of
        every monumental change? I can’t help but think this is the voice of my
        "old man" consciousness, hesitant about the unknown, clinging to the
        comfort of what has always been. History reminds us how often this voice
        is wrong. Being wary of this leap is akin to doubting the internet in
        the 1990s, fearing it would isolate us rather than connect us. And yet,
        look at what it achieved—it fueled globalization, enabled instant
        communication, and brought the collective knowledge of humanity to our
        fingertips.
      </p>
      <h2>Imagining a World Beyond the Bottleneck</h2>
      <p>
        I don’t know exactly how the world would look when we unlock the ability
        to think beyond our current limitations, but just consider the
        transformations we’ve already seen. Outsourcing communication through
        telegraphs, phones, and now instant messaging revolutionized how ideas
        spread. Externalizing memory and information through books, computers,
        and the internet exponentially accelerated progress. Each of these
        shifts didn’t just change how we interact with the world—they redefined
        what the world could be.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, imagine this next leap. What happens when we shatter the bottleneck
        of thought? When ideas, calculations, and decisions flow with the speed
        of our sensory input? It’s exhilarating to think of the possibilities.
        Perhaps creativity will no longer be constrained by the slow dance of
        deliberation, and breakthroughs in science, art, and philosophy will
        happen in moments rather than decades. Maybe empathy and understanding
        will deepen as we process and share experiences in real-time, beyond the
        barriers of language or culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the past is any indication, the world that emerges will be richer,
        more connected, and more vibrant than we can imagine. And for all its
        risks, I’d rather embrace the uncertainty of progress than settle for
        the unbearable slowness of being.
