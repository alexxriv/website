        <p>
          Through my life, I’ve always been amazed by what humanity has built. I
          often think to myself that I’m not surrounded by mere objects; I’m
          surrounded by ideas, by collaboration, by the combined effort of
          countless people. Everything around me hides stories that I can’t stop
          wondering about.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I walk down the street, I am amazed at how the city was
          designed—what materials were used to build the roads, who planned the
          layout of the neighborhoods, and how it all came together.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I watch a movie, I don’t just see actors delivering lines. I
          imagine how it was directed, what the actors were thinking, who
          designed their costumes, and how someone painstakingly wrote the
          script.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even something as simple as a park bench makes me curious—who decided
          on its design, chose the wood or metal, and placed it exactly where it
          stands?
        </p>
        <p>
          None of this is the work of one person. And that’s what astonishes me
          about humanity: our ability to collaborate on such vast scales that
          even the simplest objects carry the invisible fingerprints of
          countless hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I once read an essay titled <em>I, Pencil</em>, which captured this
          feeling perfectly. The essay is written from the perspective of a
          pencil, describing its own existence as a miracle. At first glance, a
          pencil seems simple—a piece of wood, a graphite core, a bit of metal,
          and an eraser. But when you trace its creation, you realize how
          extraordinary it really is.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wood might come from a tree in Oregon, cut down with saws, ropes,
          and other specialized tools. The graphite is mined in Sri Lanka, mixed
          with clay from Mississippi, treated with wax from Mexico, and
          transported across the globe. The metal ferrule is made from zinc and
          copper, refined and shaped into shiny brass by skilled hands. The
          eraser is crafted from oil sourced in Indonesia, mixed with additives
          from Italy. Every material has traveled great distances, passing
          through countless hands and processes—all to create a simple pencil.
        </p>
        <p>
          By now, you understand my point: nobody knows how to make a pencil.
          Not entirely. Every person involved contributes just a fraction, and
          yet, together, they produce something functional, beautiful, and
          universal. It’s a miracle that we can create anything at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          This system of global cooperation—born not out of a central plan but
          from billions of small actions—is what allows us to build
          extraordinary things. People are often impressed by the power of the
          human brain, but I think what’s even more remarkable is how billions
          of brains interact. Across cultures, languages, religions, and
          beliefs, we collaborate, sometimes unknowingly, to create a world none
          of us could build alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who designed the sidewalk? Who designed the stop sign? The water
          fountain? These things are so ubiquitous, their creators are
          forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          And perhaps that’s the ultimate goal: to create something so
          seamlessly integrated into life that it transcends individual credit.
        </p>
        <p>
          When no one remembers who made it—only that it exists, working,
          serving us all—that’s the purest testament to collaboration.
